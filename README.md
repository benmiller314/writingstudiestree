writingstudiestree
==================
The Writing Studies Tree is an online, crowdsourced database of academic genealogies within writing studies; in other words, it is an interactive archive for recording and mapping scholarly relationships in Composition and Rhetoric and adjacent disciplines. You can find it at <a href="http://writingstudiestree.org/">http://writingstudiestree.org</a>.

The WST is built in <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal 7</a>. You can read more about the team at http://writingstudiestree.org/about/team.

The writing_tree folder is a Drupal module that generates interactive visualizations from WST data using the [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library ([BSD licensed](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) from [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)). Currently, there are two main visualizations: a family tree view (tree.js) that links Person nodes, and a force-directed graph (network.js) that links Person and Institution nodes.

The module code was produced initially by [Matt Miller](http://thisismattmiller.com), and updated by [Jeff Binder](http://jeffreymbinder.net/), with minor tweaks by [Ben Miller](http://majoringinmeta.net), thanks to funding from Provost's Digital Initiative Grants at The Graduate Center, CUNY.
