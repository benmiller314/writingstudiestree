writingstudiestree
==================
The Writing Studies Tree is an online, crowdsourced database of academic genealogies within writing studies; in other words, it is an interactive archive for recording and mapping scholarly relationships in Composition and Rhetoric and adjacent disciplines. You can find it at <a href="http://writingstudiestree.org/">http://writingstudiestree.org</a>.

The WST is built in <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal 7</a>. Custom modules (eg for data visualization) will be shared here.
